# Iterative Vectors

[**Iterative Vectors: In-Context Gradient Steering without Backpropagation**](https://openreview.net/forum?id=1v3XEcRMyP)

Iterative Vectors enhance in-context learning by editing activations in language models with simulated gradients, demonstrating significant improvements across tasks without backpropagation.

The source code for this project is currently being prepared for public release.
We will upload the complete codebase to this repository as soon as it is ready.
Please check back soon for updates.
